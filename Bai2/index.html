                        Sometimes this is due to personal preference, and other times due to cultural background. 
                        Color theory is a science in itself. Studying how colors affect different people, either 
                        individually or as a group, is something some people build their careers on. And there’s a 
                        lot to it. Something as simple as changing the exact hue or saturation of a color can evoke 
                        a completely different feeling. Cultural differences mean that something that’s happy and 
                        uplifting in one country can be depressing in another.</p>
